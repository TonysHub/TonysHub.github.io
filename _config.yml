  안녕하세요, 토론토에서 날아온 Django & Python / AWS & Docker 기반의 백엔드 개발자입니다. :rocket: <br>
  캐나다에서는 학업을 병행하며 방학마다 인턴 기회를 찾아다녔습니다. **누적 투자액 3조원**의 벤쳐 캐피탈, **일 주문 2만건** 이상의 식료품 서비스 앱 회사에서 총 16개월 데이터 사이언티스트 인턴으로 근무하며
  Ad-tech 사업에 관한 이해도를 높이며, 고객 코호트 분석과 Amplitude 데이터 스키마 구축을 했습니다.
  기존 경력을 활용하여, REST API와 인프라를 구성할 때도 데이터 활용 가능성을 고려하며, 데이터 보안을 우선 시 하는 개발자입니다. <br> 
  업무 / 프로젝트 활용 기술:
  <mark>Django</mark>, 
  <mark>AWS</mark>,
  <mark>Docker</mark>,
  <mark>Postgres</mark>,
  <mark>Airflow</mark>.
  
  학교 졸업 후 한국으로 돌아와 특전사로 18개월 군 복무(2021.06 ~ 2022.12)를 마치고, 현재 프로그래머스 데이터 엔지니어링 데브코스 수강(2023.05~2023.09)과 개인 프로젝트를 병행하고 있습니다. <br>
  데브코스에는 팀장 역할을 맡으며, 다른 팀원들이 교육을 잘 따라올 수 있도록 리드하고 있습니다.

          During my time at Simitive I worked as part of an agile team building our own in house web based software and
          also a large scale website for an international client. I gained experience working with a continuous integration
          workflow using tools such as <mark>Jenkins</mark> and working with Amazon Web Services for deployments. We built most
          of our software using <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Backbone</mark>, <mark>Marionette</mark>, <mark>Vue</mark> and <mark>Vuex</mark>.

          For 6 months I was working on delivering a standalone web product for an international client that services over
          600,000 users. This has been built from the ground up using <mark>Symfony</mark> to provide a backend API and
          <mark>Backbone</mark> for the front end. I also gained a lot of experience with <mark>Elasticsearch</mark> to provide
          search functionality of millions of entities to the front end. During the project I spent time out of hours
          communicating with the client, performing deployments and providing support.

          Towards the end of my time at Simitive my role involved assisting with the company's devOps, this included managing
          our <mark>AWS</mark> infrastructure as well as deploying and migrating sites. I also spent time configuring and maintaining
          our clients SSO, this mostly involves configuring new clients who are using <mark>AD FS</mark>, <mark>Shibboleth</mark> and
          <mark>CAS</mark> but also maintaining our software's SSO functionality.

          I was asked to update an existing Android app to the latest version of Android and to fix any issues caused by
          this as well as a few other existing issues. This project had a very tight time scale and I was able to complete
          it in very good time while providing regular updates to the client.

          While working at Nudge I was able to work on a large number of projects ranging from small Drupal sites to large
          enterprise level applications. I enjoy being able to work with clients to understand and surpass their expectations.
          At Nudge I was also given the oppertunity to work with all of my core skills and to gain new skills in things
          such as <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Angular</mark> and <mark>Gulp</mark>. I also worked on a number of <mark>iOS</mark> and
          <mark>Android</mark> applications.

          During my time at Nudge I was able to help the lead developer with the writing of Technical Specifications and
          also Project Requirements. I feel this is a useful skill to have as it helps me to become an even more well-rounded
          developer.

          During the summer I had the opportunity to head to Accra, Ghana and work with the team out there. This was a
          great opportunity to learn more about the industry in another country but also to allow me to lead their
          team for a few weeks and gain lots of experience of remote teams.

          I started working for GWS Media part time during my third year at University and continued full time once I had
          graduated. It was during this role that I learnt many of the fundamentals that I have been building on over
          the past 3 years. Whilst at GWS I had the opportunity to work with:
          <mark>Drupal</mark>, <mark>Magento</mark>, <mark>Bootstrap</mark>, <mark>Codeigniter</mark>, <mark>Android</mark> and <mark>iOS</mark>.

          I feel like having the opportunity to use a large range of different things early on in my career has given me
          the drive to always want to try new tools and frameworks.

          The API for this site has been build using <mark>Node.js</mark> while the front end is a <mark>React</mark>/<mark>Redux</mark> app.
          I have used <mark>Docker</mark> to set up a development environment and <mark>Heroku</mark> to deploy and host the site. I have
          a suite of unit and API tests for the backend and unit tests for the front end.

          I have been using this project as a way to increase many of my skills and also learn new things, most recently sockets and Node.JS. I have particually
          enjoyed managing my own project and designing my own architecture and implementing this to a high standard.

          Feel free to check out the whole project on GitHub to get a feel for how I work [here](https://github.com/sproogen/itsgoingto.be).

      When I'm not sat at my desk I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I do a lot a sports such as
      mountain biking, road cycling, kitesuring and horse riding as well as trying to make time for things like
      rock climbing and playing some rugby. I currently have 2 horses and find this is a great way to get out of the house
      and taking my mind of things while learing to showjump.

      I'm interested in photography and videography as I like to be creative, this is mainly through sport but
      I enjoy landscape and abstract photography too. I like to showcase my work on instagram if
      you would like to take a look - [jameswgrant](https://www.instagram.com/jameswgrant/).

      Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me working on my bikes, rock climbing at one of
      Bristol's indoor climbing centres or down 'The Rec' supporting Bath Rugby.
